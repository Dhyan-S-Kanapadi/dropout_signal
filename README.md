# Dropout Signal

Early warning system that detects student dropout risk weeks before 
it appears in grades — built on Databricks.

## What it does
- Assigns every student a continuous risk score from 0 to 1
- Detects deteriorating trends in grades, attendance, and engagement
- Explains the top 3 factors driving each student's score
- Audits predictions for fairness across gender and socioeconomic groups
- Outputs an intervention table: who needs help, why, and what to do

## What makes this different
Most systems flag dropout after grades have already fallen.
This system detects the trajectory — weeks before it shows up.

## Built with
- Databricks (everything runs here)
- Delta Lake
- XGBoost
- SHAP
- MLflow
